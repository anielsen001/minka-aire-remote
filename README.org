#+TITLE: Controlling several MinkaAire ceiling fan/lights with a Raspberry Pi

* MinkaAire remote

Disassembled the MinkaAire remove control. The buttons are effectively pushed when the two contacts are shorted by a springy contact. A relay will make the connection between the two contacts. 

The remote is powered by a 12 V battery.

* Relays

Using a 5V relay module similar to this one. The important fact to note is that the Vcc is common and the pins must be set to ground in order to activate the relay.

* Raspberry Pi

Using a Raspberry Pi 2. The python gpiozero library and pinouts are found here:
https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/recipes.html

the pi itself can be powered off the 2 and 6 pins, instead of the micro usb port. 

Install ipython3 for testing

#+begin_src sh
sudo apt install ipython3
#+end_src
